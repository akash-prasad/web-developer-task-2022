  <h1>Queering identity</h1>
  <article class="footnotes-article">

      <p>Queer theory and activism have responded to discrimination and
      hatred by taking a word that had historically been used to insult gay
      people - 'queer' - and reclaiming it as a radical tool. But queer
      isn't just about claiming justice or freedom or tolerance or
      acceptance for particular identity categories, but about resisting
      dominant forces, undermining majority positions.</p>
      <p><span class="citation">In 1992, film critic B. Ruby Rich coined the
      term 'new queer cinema' to describe a generation of queer filmmakers
      that 'poured its heart and soul, shock and anger into modes of
      representation capable of spinning new styles out of old and new
      genres out of those that had worn out'. <span class="ref">Rich, B.
      Ruby, <em>New Queer Cinema: The Director's Cut </em>(Durham, NC: Duke
      University Press, 2013), p. 13.</span></span><span
      class="citation">The 'queer' films released in this period - such as
      Todd Haynes's <em>Poison</em> and Cheryl Dunye's <em>Watermelon
      Woman</em> are 'irreverent, energetic [...] and excessive. And above
      all, they're full of pleasure'.<span class="ref">Rich, B. Ruby,
      <em>New Queer Cinema: The Director's Cut </em>(Durham, NC: Duke
      University Press, 2013), p. 18.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="citation">Queer isn't just about trying to advocate
      for gay rights within the existing political system but about creating
      oppositional positions. So we have the idea that queer, in David
      Halperin's words, is 'by definition whatever is at odds with the
      normal, the legitimate, the dominant'.<span class="ref">Halperin,
      <em>David, Saint Foucault: Towards a Gay Hagiography</em> (New York:
      Oxford University Press, 1997), p. 62.</span></span>But as we
      discussed in week 1, <span class="citation">discourses of 'diversity'
      <strong>can </strong>serve to 'contain and restrain resistance'.

      Conditions', in David Theo Goldberg (ed.) <em>Multiculturalism: A
